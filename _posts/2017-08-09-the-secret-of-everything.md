# The Secret of Everything

## Don't Just "Get It" -- Experience It -- NOW!

For
a long time after I first learned about the 3 Principles -- the so called 'inside-out'
understanding -- I noticed I often felt I was "getting it" intellectually -- but that
something was still missing.   It seemed
like I wasn't really getting it all at an experiential level.

And
it seemed this was something many other people were struggling with. 

It
took me just around 2 years to finally see through -- and past -- what turned out
to have been just an innocent misunderstanding.   And what then became very clear to me was --
that it really is possible for all of us to experience "The Secret of
Everything" -- not tomorrow -- or sometime in the future -- but right now! 

So
-- if you've ever noticed yourself saying -- or thinking to yourself -- something
along the lines of ... "I understand this intellectually -- but that doesn't seem
to be enough.   I just don't seem to 'get
it' experientially" -- and you'd like to see, hear and experience something "deeper"
-- I'm running The Secret of Everything -- Don't Just "Get It" -- Experience It --
Now -- online program -- especially for you (and for me because it's fun!).
