# The Secret of Everything

## Don't Just "Get It" -- Experience It -- NOW!

For a long time after I first learned about the 3 Principles -- the so called 'inside-out' understanding -- I noticed I often felt I was "getting it" intellectually -- but that something was still missing. It seemed like I wasn't really getting it all at an experiential level.

And it seemed this was something many other people were struggling with.

It took me just around 2 years to finally see through -- and past -- what turned out to have been just an innocent misunderstanding. And what then became very clear to me was -- that it really is possible for all of us to experience "The Secret of Everything" -- not tomorrow -- or sometime in the future -- but right now!

So -- if you've ever noticed yourself saying -- or thinking to yourself -- something along the lines of ... "I understand this intellectually -- but that doesn't seem to be enough. I just don't seem to 'get it' experientially" -- and you'd like to see, hear and experience something "deeper" -- I'm running The Secret of Everything -- Don't Just "Get It" -- Experience It -- Now -- online program -- especially for you (and for me because it's fun!).
